## Tech Stack

Currently, the website is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular React framework, combined with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. The backend is built with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), an open-source Firebase alternative with a PostgreSQL database. [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) was also used as a lightweight ORM to aid in database queries. Finally, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) was used as a hosting platform for the website.
